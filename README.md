# DefenceMania
In on of my summer internships, I joined a local video game studio called DigitalMania located in Tunisia to, during which I developed a local multi-player 2D Tower Defense strategy video game that uses AI. The game has multiple waves with different settings and the difficulty increases with each wave. The player controls a Hero character and manages an army of soldier and torrents (that he can place on the map) against the enemy army/turrets.

# Tools I used:
- Unity 3D
- C#
- Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator
